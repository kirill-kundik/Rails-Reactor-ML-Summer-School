# RR ML Course

## Lectures

## Homework assignments

See [tasks](/tasks) for homework assignments.

## MR processes

When working on task, prefer doing it in [feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). Keep in mind you want each homework to be done in different branch. After you are done, open a [new merge request](https://ml-course-git.railsreactor.net/summer-19/summer-19/merge_requests/new) and assign lecturer as a reviewer. After possibly receiving review comments, fix them and when done tag mentor again to merge MR.
